## tools
the design was made in [inkscape](https://inkscape.org) by zohar, then rotoscoped in [eagle](www.autodesk.com/products/eagle) EDA to preper the board for manufacturing. 

[svg2shenzen](https://github.com/badgeek/svg2shenzhen) is an extension to inkscape that allows you to design a board in inkscape and export it to a [kicad](https://kicad.github.io) (another EDA for pcb making), from kicad you can export gerber files. i used that route for the silkscreen only. its much nicer the eagle "import BMP" script. 

[gerbv](http://gerbv.geda-project.org) was then used to preview the gerber output and move the silkscreen to its right position.
